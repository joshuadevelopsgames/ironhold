# Ironhold (NeoForge mod)

**Mod id `ironhold`** · **Minecraft `26.1.2`** · **NeoForge `26.1.2.48-beta`** (`gradle.properties` → `neo_version`) · **Java 21**

Playable / testable dev runs:

```bash
./gradlew runClient    # client with mod loaded
./gradlew runServer    # dedicated test server (then connect via localhost)
./gradlew build        # output: build/libs/ironhold-<version>.jar
```

Ironhold is a large kingdom-themed RPG overhaul: kingdoms & classes, a skill/profession
system, voiced AI NPCs, custom entities (knights, mages, mimics, deer, shulker castes),
seasons, built-in dynamic lighting, fishing/blacksmithing minigames, accessories, and a
custom terrain framework. The Java packages live under `kingdom.smp`.

### Implemented from the markdowns (stubs)

1. **Player RPG data** — `PlayerKingdomRpgData` attachment (kingdom index 0–3, class, class level + XP bar), **persists**, **copies on death**, and **syncs to the client** (HUD / inventory weight cap match the server).  
2. **Kingdom pooled XP + gates** — `KingdomWorldData` on the **Overworld**; **Nether/End travel blocked** until any kingdom’s pool hits thresholds (`KingdomWorldData.NETHER_UNLOCK_XP` / `END_UNLOCK_XP`).  
3. **Encumbrance** — tag-based **carry weight** vs class max; **movement speed** penalty + **Slowness** when over cap; **HUD + inventory** show weight (no hotbar spam).  
4. **Class stats** — Per-class **max health, attack damage, move speed** (Knight slower, Ranger/Rogue faster per class GUI) and **Rogue attack speed**; **every 5 class levels** adds a tier: +1 heart max, +0.25 attack, +1% move (stacks with class move bonus). Encumbrance still applies its own speed penalty when over carry.  
5. **XP bar** — vanilla bar is **driven by class level + class XP** each tick (not the same as vanilla mob XP totals). **XP to next level** = `40 + classLevel * 26` (softer than ×30).  
6. **Class XP from combat** — `ClassXpKillRewards`: **monsters** scale with max health (capped); **bosses** (dragon / wither / warden / elder guardian) large flat XP; **other mobs** (animals, ambient, water) **1–2** XP; **villagers & armor stands** give none. **PVP** grants XP by **killer’s class** (Rogue highest); **Rogue** gets **+40** when the kill is from **behind** (rear arc). **Class-favored targets** (`data/kingdom20/tags/entity_type/*_favored.json`) grant **~+30%** class XP (not bosses / not PVP). All use `RpgProgressionActions` (kingdom pool + sync).  
7. **Patrol spawns** — `KingdomPatrolSpawnHandler`: ~**4%** of eligible overworld **natural-style** spawns (see `patrol_buff_candidates` tag) get **+6 max HP**, **iron sword**, a **kingdom-style name**, and **`BubbleOwner`** = entity UUID (for **Notable Bubble Text** `/bubbletext`, if you add that mod).

**Cheats / OP:** `/k2` (requires gamemaster permission — e.g. cheats on singleplayer).

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/k2 whoami` | Show kingdom, class, level, XP into level |
| `/k2 class set <peasant\|knight\|…>` | Set class |
| `/k2 kingdom set <0-3>` | Set kingdom index |
| `/k2 classxp add <amount> [players]` | Add class XP (also adds same amount to that player’s kingdom pool) |
| `/k2 classxp remove <amount>` | Remove class XP (can de-level; floors at L1) |
| `/k2 kingdomxp add <0-3> <amount>` | Add pooled kingdom XP only |
| `/k2 gates` | Show pool totals and Nether/End lock state |
| `/k2 weight` | Show computed carry weight vs class cap (debug) |
| `/k2 classgui` / `kingdomgui` / `profile` | Open selection / profile screens (syncs RPG packet first) |

**Quick test:** `/k2 gates` → `/k2 kingdomxp add 0 500` → Nether portal should work; open inventory (**E**) — **Weight: current/max** appears to the **right** of the panel; bottom-right HUD shows the same when no menu is open (class + XP bar stacked above it).
